# k8s-kthw-hcloud

This executes the [kubernetes-the-hard-way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) for Hetzner Cloud.

# Usage

To run the all of these script, just run `run.sh`:

```bash
$ ./run.sh
```

# WARNING

For now, the `run.sh` doesn't cleanup the resources. So, if you want to cleanup them,
you need to run `14-cleanup.sh` manually.
